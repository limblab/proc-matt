% use weights from baseline to explain curl field
%   do they exist in the same space or different spaces?

% use cross validation for M1, PMd, and both
%   what are the number of latent dimensions?

% fit one low-D space to M1 and PMd, look at clustering of loading from
% each area onto the low D space 
%   Are M1 and PMd living in different dimensions or blurred together?
%   Also compare the same brain region between the two different tasks

% Look at constrained GPFA model
